         <h3>History</h3>
         <p> Human habitation of the area started about 8,000 years ago with small family groups of Native Americans, </p>
         <p>The Historic period begins in the late 18th century with the exploration of southern Utah by Padres Silvestre Vélez de Escalante and Francisco Atanasio Domínguez. The padres passed near what is now the Kolob Canyons Visitor Center on October 13, 1776, becoming the first people of European descent known to visit the area.</p>

      <p> Sweet words from Nicholas Gordon about Zion National Park:  </p>
    Zion Canyon is the work of water
    In concert with the winds that shape the heart.
    One sees a grandeur equal to one's wonder;
    Nor can one be, but of such grace a part.
